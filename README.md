MoviesFinderApp:

The app is meant to help people search for a movie from TheMovieDb. It has a finder where you can search movies based on a keyword. Also, you can filter movies based on release years, rating, genre, language. The app also shows the most popular movies and top rated movies.

- I used the newest Android technologies (Jetpack Compose, Flows, Compose Navigation)
